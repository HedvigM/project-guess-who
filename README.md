# Project Name
Guess Who

The assignment was to create a game of "guess who". Since it was a long time ago i played that game, i had to remind myself of how to play the game before i started to write the code. We had some code in the project to begin with, the CSS and the HTML was already there, but i decided to make some changes to the design in the CSS. 

## The problem

I am al in al satisfied with the project, if i had more time i would incorporate som sounds and make a timer, a counter and some confetti rain (to show the winner). This week was all about the javaScript and i felt that i had control over the workflow, but i felt a need to learn some syntax more fluently.
